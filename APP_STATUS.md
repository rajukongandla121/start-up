# ✅ VentureLink App Status - FIXED

## 🚀 **Current Status: WORKING**

✅ **Server**: Running successfully at `http://localhost:8080`  
✅ **Error Fixed**: Dynamic require issue with mongoose resolved  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints functional  
✅ **Database Mode**: Hybrid (MongoDB + localStorage fallback)  

## 🔧 **Issue Fixed**

**Problem**: `Dynamic require of "mongoose" is not supported`  
**Cause**: ES module trying to use CommonJS `require()` syntax  
**Solution**: Replaced dynamic `require('mongoose')` with static `import mongoose`

### **Changes Made:**
```typescript
// ❌ Before (causing error)
const mongoConnected = require('mongoose').connection.readyState === 1;

// ✅ After (fixed)
import mongoose from "mongoose";
const mongoConnected = mongoose.connection.readyState === 1;
```
